## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the server for chat on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Server must have connection with MySQL-database. You can create your own localhost database using *chat_db.sql* file.<br>
Anyway, you can use connection with database deployed to Heroku. This config is used by default. This way it's not necessary to install MySQL.<br>

Note, you have to install [Client](https://github.com/Nislupko/chat-client) to use chat application
